 Modifications I have made to Apple's source.
 1.  Added keys to the info.plist file to allow for backgrounding.
 2.  Removed the text view and replaced it with a simple UILabel.
 3.  Fixed the peripheral so that it just automatically advertises; removed the UISwitch.
 4.  Fixed the central so that it stays connected until you tell it to go away.
 5.  Added RSSI / Signal Strength to the Central View, so you know how close you are to the Peripheral.
 6.  You'll find my comments started with "BK" (Bob Kressin) throughout Apple's source.
